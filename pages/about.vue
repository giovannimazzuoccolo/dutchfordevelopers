          Dutch for developers is my first project that follows the philosophy
          of "<UILink href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/" target="_new"
            >Learning in public</UILink
          >". I wrote down all my notes from my dutch courses, reorganized them,
          had them reviewed by Dutch native speakers and published them here.<br />
          Aside from the notes, I created some small games that help to memorise
          Dutch words and grammar rules in a fun way. I followed the same
          approach as the
          <UILink href="https://dutchlanguagecafe.com/" target="_new"
            >Dutch language caf√©</UILink
          >
          in Den Haag (The Hague for English speakers). Of course, games are
          more fun if you can play with your friends, classmates or developers,
          but you can play anytime and anywhere.

          Ok, this is getting technical, so feel free to skip this part if you
          are not interested :) <br />
          The frontend is built in nuxt.js, a vue.js framework. From 2017 to
          2022, I always used React.js to build SaSS products, and I just wanted
          to try something new. The backend is Supabase, which just keeps the
          progress of the courses.
