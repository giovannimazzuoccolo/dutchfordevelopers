                Dutch for developers is my first project
                that follows the philosophy of "<UILink
                    href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/"
                    target="_new"
                    >Learning in public</UILink
                >". I wrote down all my notes from my dutch
                courses, reorganized them, had them reviewed
                by Dutch native speakers and published them
                here.</UIArticleBlock

                Aside from the notes, I created some small
                games that help to memorise Dutch words and
                grammar rules in a fun way. I followed the
                same approach as the
                <UILink
                    href="https://dutchlanguagecafe.com/"
                    target="_new"
                    >Dutch language caf√©</UILink
                >
                in Den Haag (The Hague for English
                speakers). Of course, games are more fun if
                you can play with your friends, classmates
                or developers, but you can play anytime and
                anywhere.
