## Pronouns

Pronouns (Voornaamwoorden) are the _references_ of the Dutch language. They substitute nouns.

### üôÄ Stressed and unstressed üòå

Before starting, we need to talk about stressed and unstressed pronouns. In Dutch, if you want to emphasize a part of the sentence, you will use a stressed pronoun. You can see the examples in the following table that shows all the personal pronouns

‚ÄºÔ∏è this list is different from the list you can find in Dutch grammar books. I prefer to spread all the pronouns so you can see some "duplicates" in the English column.

| Pronouns | English translation | ‚ÑπÔ∏è comments        |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Ik       | I                   | abbreviation: 'k   |
| Jij      | you                 | stressed version   |
| Je       | you                 | unstressed version |
| U        | you                 | formal version     |
| Hij      | He                  |                    |
| Zij      | She                 | stressed version   |
| Ze       | She                 | unstressed version |
| Wij      | He                  | stressed version   |
| We       | We                  | unstressed version |
