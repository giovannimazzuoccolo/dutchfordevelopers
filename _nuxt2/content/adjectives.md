## Adjectives

Adjectives are used for describing qualities or characteristics of a noun or a pronoun.

The first difference between English is the position on the sentence. Adjectives goes **before** the noun, in English is the opposite. Also, they have different forms, which changes depending on the gender or number of the associated noun.

To simplify, we can categorize the adjectives in two groups: Attributive and Predicative.

### Attributive adjectives

Attributive adjectives modify a noun, for example:

De grote markt. (The big market)

Pretty simple: the adjective "grote" will modify the noun "markt" giving information about its size. Fun fact: many cities in The Netherlands have "Grote Markt" as a name of a square or a place.
Let's make other examples:

-   Mijn nieuwe baan (My new job)
-   Een rode auto (A red car)

As you can see, the adjective follows the noun gender and number.

### Predicative adjectives

Predicative adjectives (bijvoeglijk naamwoordelijk deel) are used to describe the subject of a sentence. They are very simple, for example:

-   De kat is zwart (The cat is black)
-   De hond is groot (The dog is big)

Sometimes, on daily spoken language, the verb is omitted, for example:

-   Zij moe. (She's tired)
-   Hij interessant. (He's interesting)
-   De muziek loud (The loud music)

The Predicative adjectives don't follow the noun on gender or number, and they are after the verb (or is omitted, as shown on the second case).

The following list provides the most common dutch adjectives (some of them are similar to English!)
