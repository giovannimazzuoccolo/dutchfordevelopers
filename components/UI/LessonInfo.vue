            Do you see some errors or something that should be improved?<br /><br />
            There are two way to do this, a technical one and a simple one. The technical one is to
            <NuxtLink to="/contacts"
                ><span class="underline text-main-orange">open a pull request</span></NuxtLink
            >
            on the project, you need only a github account (which probably you already used for
            logging in), and a simple one, which is to use the
            <NuxtLink to="/contacts"
                ><span class="underline text-main-orange">contact page</span></NuxtLink
            >
            to send me a message directly
        </p>
