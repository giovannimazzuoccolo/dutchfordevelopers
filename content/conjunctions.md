## Conjunctions

If you want to link words, clauses, phrases you need to use a conjunction. We can divide them in two categories: 
**coordinating** and **subordinating** conjunctions.

### Coordinating conjunctions

When you need to connect two concepts that are equals on a sentence, you use a coordinating conjunction. 
It's easier than you think, let's see some examples, the conjunction is marked in **bold**

* Ik ben moe **en** ik wil naar bed. (I am tired and I want to go to bed.)
* Wil je thee **of** koffie? (Do you want tea or coffee?)

Let's take the second example: Thee (tea) or Koffie (coffee) they have the same importance on the sentence. 
En and of are the most common used to connect different phrases.

Following a list of coordinating conjunctions:
