## Preposition

Think about prepositions as links between words, to establish relationship between them.

If you already living in the Netherlands, you will probably have seen prepositions quite often. Let's start with one which is very common in supermarkets:

### Op ☝️

De pen ligt op de tafel. (The pen is on the table.)

Op is used also in advertising, in this form OP=OP, which means that the product or the offer is valid until the supplies last, or a certain quantity is sold

### Aan 👉

Aan (on, to): Ik geef het cadeau aan mijn moeder. (I give the gift to my mother.)

De tas ligt aan de tafel. (The bag is on the table.)

As you can see, Aan is used also in "on" context, as "op". It depends on the context of the sentence to decide if we need to use "op" or "aan". But in general "aan" is used for direct or close relationships, while op for indirect relationships.
With practice, you can master them easily.

### In 📥

In (in, inside): De kat zit in de doos. (The cat is inside the box.)

In is similar to the English counterpart, so nothing to add here.

### Van (of, from) 👨‍👩‍👧

De auto is van mijn vader. (The car is my father's.)

"Van" is also common on Dutch surnames (honestly from all the Germanic and Scandinavian languages), to indicate a person's place of origin or ancestral homeland.

### Bij (at, by, with):

Ik ben bij mijn vriend. (I am with my friend.)

This is a following table with the most common Dutch prepositions:
