## Verbs

Verbs (werkwoorden) describes an action or state of being of our sentence. Because they play an important role, it is good to learn them well.

### ‚è™¬†Past, present ‚ñ∂Ô∏è and future ‚è©

We have 3 tenses, past, present and future. Fortunately the conjugation is quite simple for the regular verbs. Let's start with the present.

‚ÅâÔ∏è If you want to have a refresh of the pronouns (used in the following table) [you can go back to the pronouns page](/learn/pronouns)

Let's conjugate the verb _werken_ which means "to work".

| Conjugation   | English translation | ‚ÑπÔ∏è comments          |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Ik werk       | I work              | Just the base "werk" |
| Jij/Je werkt  | you work            | "werk" + t           |
| U werkt       | you work            | formal version       |
| Hij werkt     | He works            | "werk" + t           |
| Zij werkt     | She works           | "werk" + t           |
| Het werkt     | It works            | "werk" + t           |
| Wij werken    | We work             | "werk" + en          |
| Jullie werken | You work            | (plural) "werk" + en |
| Zij werken    | They work           | "werk" + en          |

_Werken_ is a regular verb, so we use as our blueprint for conjugate all the other verbs.

We have the root, "Werk" which is used on the first person singular form. To conjugate all the other forms, you need to add some endings.
For the second and the third forms you need to add a "t". For all the plural forms, you need to add "en", as you conjugate a noun in plural.

[Don't remember the nouns? You can go back to the specific lesson](/learn/nouns)

Of course there are exceptions. For example, the verb _leren_, to learn. This verb is still regular, but with some letters switching for the singular version to have a better distinction between the plural.

| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Ik leer      | I learn             | We add an extra _e_ for the first person singular |
| Jij/Je leert | you learn           | "leer" + t                                        |
| U leert      | you learn           | "leer" + t                                        |
| Hij leert    | He learns           | leer" + t                                         |
| Zij leert    | She learns          | leer" + t                                         |
| Het leert    | It learns           | leer" + t                                         |
| Wij leren    | We work             | ler" + en (the extra _e_ is dropped)              |
| Jullie leren | You learn           | (plural) "ler" + en                               |
| Zij leren    | They learn          | "ler" + en                                        |

After defined the regular verbs, we can approach the irregular, starting for the auxiliary ones: "zjin" (to be)

Zjin:

| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Ik ben         | I am                |
| Jij/Je bent    | you are             |
| Hij/zij/het is | He/She/It is        |
| Wij zijn       | We are              |
| Jullie zijn    | You are             |
| Zij zijn       | They are            |

Fortunately, the other auxiliary verb "hebben", (to have), is regular:

| Conjugation       | English translation |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Ik heb            | I have              |
| Jij/je hebt       | You have            |
| Hij/zij/het heeft | He/she/it has       |
| Wij hebben        | We have             |
| Jullie hebben     | You have            |
| Zij hebben        | They have           |

The auxiliary verbs help you to create complex sentences, as:

"Ik ben naar huis gegaan." (I have gone home.)

As you can see, "ben" is the first person singular form of "zijn" and is used as an auxiliary verb to form the compound verb "naar huis gegaan" (to have gone home).
"Gegaan" is the past participle form of the verb "gaan" (to go).
The compound verb "naar huis gegaan" expresses the completed action of going home.

### üëÜ Past participle

With "gegaan" we introduced another verb form: the past participle.

In Dutch, the past participle is usually formed by adding -d, -t, or -en to the base form of the verb or ge- at the beginning (old Dutch) Some verbs also have irregular past participles.

### ‚è≥ Past form

Let's start to divide in two categories: regular and irregular past form.

The regular past tense is formed by adding -de or -te to the root of the verb (mostly the first person singular). The choice between -de and -te is based on the final sound of the root. If the stem ends in a voiceless consonant (e.g. k, t, p), -te is added. If the root ends in a voiced consonant (e.g. b, d, g), -de is added. For example:

"Ik werkte gisteren." (I worked yesterday.)

"Zij wandelde in het park." (She walked in the park.)

For the irregular version, the verb changes independently of its root.
In these following examples, "zag" and "bracht" are strong (irregular) past tense forms of the verbs "zien" (to see) and "brengen" (to bring).

Ik zag hem gisteren. (I saw him yesterday.)
Zij bracht haar moeder naar het vliegveld. (She took her mother to the airport.)

### ‚åõÔ∏è Future form

Probably the easiest form to learn. We need to use the verb Zullen (shall/will) plus the verb in infinitive form. A classic example is:

Ik zal morgen naar de stad gaan. (I will go to the city tomorrow.)

Unfortunately, the verb Zullen is irregular, you can find the conjugation on the next table.

| Conjugation     | English translation    |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Ik zal          | I shall/will           |
| Jij/u zult      | You shall/will         |
| Hij/zij/het zal | (He/She/It shall/will) |
| Wij zullen      | We shall/will          |
| Julle zullen    | You all shall/will     |
| Zij zullen      | They shall/will        |
