## Pronouns

Pronouns (Voornaamwoorden) are the _references_ of the Dutch language. They substitute nouns.

### üôÄ Stressed and unstressed üòå

Before starting, we need to talk about what is a stressed or an unstressed pronouns. In Dutch, if you want to put emphasis on a part of the sentence, you will use a stressed pronoun. You can see the examples on the following table that shows all the personal pronouns

### üë• Plural

The plural version of names in Dutch can be in two possibilities: The most common is with the suffix **-en** but some nouns have a **-s** as a suffix. With, _unfortunately_, few exceptions. For example:

#### ‚è¨ Diminutives

Diminutives (verkleinwoorden) are common in Dutch. There are not used only to indicate small things, but they can have other meanings, is used often to "enjoy the little things of life". You can make a noun diminutive adding _-je_, _-tje_, _-etje_, _-pje_ at the end of the word. Read all the types on the following table.

### üëâArticles

The Dutch language has 2 types of articles, definite (_de_ or _het_) and indefinite article (_een_). For _het_ and _een_ is possible to find them in their compressed versions: het ‚Üí _'t_ and een ‚Üí _'n_

#### ü§î De and Het, what to choose?

Yes, the Dutch language has two articles for the definite type. **De** and **Het**. For example, the most famous Dutch Newspaper is "De Telegraaf", meanwhile the Dutch national anthem is called "Het Wilhelmus". Technically, the masculine and the feminine nouns have **De** has definite article, and the neuter is **Het**; plural nouns have always **De**. There is a little trick, if you don't remember which article to choose, you can make your noun

There is a long article on wikipedia regarding [Gender in Dutch Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_in_Dutch_grammar), explaining the gender in Dutch, which helps a lot to get the correct article. Another important website is [welklidwoord.nl](https://www.welklidwoord.nl/), where you can use the search bar for discover if the searched Dutch word has De or Het as article. I've made a small table which some good insights:

| Nouns type                      | Article        | Example                                                                    |
