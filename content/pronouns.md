## Pronouns

Pronouns (Voornaamwoorden) are the _references_ of the Dutch language. They substitute nouns.

### 🙀 Stressed and unstressed 😌

Before starting, we need to talk about what is a stressed or an unstressed pronouns. In Dutch, if you want to put emphasis on a part of the sentence, you will use a stressed pronoun. You can see the examples on the following table that shows all the personal pronouns

‼️ this list is different from the common list that you can find in Dutch grammar books. I prefer to spread all the pronouns, so you can see some "duplicates"

| Pronouns | English translation | ℹ️ comments        |

| Ik       | I                   | abbreviation: 'k   |

| Je       | you                 | unstressed version |
| U        | you                 | formal version     |
