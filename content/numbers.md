## Numbers

From groceries shopping till the daily work, numbers make an important role on our life.

Let's start counting till 20. Instead of a table, let's use an ordered list:

0. nul - zero
1. één - one
2. twee - two
3. drie - three
4. vier - four
5. vijf - five
6. zes - six
7. zeven - seven
8. acht - eight
9. negen - nine
10. tien - ten
11. elf - eleven
12. twaalf - twelve
13. dertien - thirteen
14. veertien - fourteen
15. vijftien - fifteen
16. zestien - sixteen
17. zeventien - seventeen
18. achttien - eighteen
19. negentien - nineteen
20. twintig - twenty

### from 20 to 99

A difference between the English numbering to the Dutch one appear for numbers from 20 to 99: those numbers are formed
by stating the number of tens (e.g. "twintig" for 20) and then adding the ones digit (e.g. "twee" for 2) after "en" (
meaning "and"). For example, "twenty-two" is "tweeëntwintig" in Dutch, which translates to "two and twenty" in English.

### from 100 and more...

If you want to count from 100 and more, you can use the following table:

| Number    | Dutch          | English Translation  |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| 100       | honderd        | hundred              |
| 200       | tweehonderd    | two hundred          | 
| 1000      | duizend        | thousand             | 
| 10,000    | tienduizend    | ten thousand         |
| 100,000   | honderdduizend | one hundred thousand |
| 1,000,000 | een miljoen    | one million          |

### Ordinal numbers

What we saw before are Cardinal numbers. Now let's talk about Ordinal numbers, used for representing the position or order of a number in a list.
In Dutch, ordinal numbers are formed by adding the suffix "-de" or "-ste" to the cardinal numbers, depending on the context. For example, "first" in Dutch is "eerste", which is derived from the cardinal number "één" (one) and the suffix "-ste".
