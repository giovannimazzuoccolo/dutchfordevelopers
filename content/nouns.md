## Nouns

Nouns are the _variables_ of the Dutch language. They describe "_things_"

### ‚ùì Does Dutch have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender" target="_blank">nouns genders</a>?

Yes, they are masculine, feminine, and neuter; but compared to other languages (Italian or Spanish, for example), they have no grammatical distinction between masculine and feminine, the only distinction is between common (masculine and feminine) and neuter.

### üë• Plural

The plural version of names in Dutch can be in two possibilities: The most common is with the suffix **-en** but some nouns have a **-s** as a suffix. With, _unfortunately_, few exceptions. For example:
